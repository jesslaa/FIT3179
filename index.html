                    <p>In today's interconnected global landscape, the world economy is an intricate tapestry of trade,
                        investment, and commerce.
                        Within this vast expanse, a select group stands out: the billionaires. These individuals, through
                        entrepreneurship,</p>

                        countries.
                        Now it is time to explore into their origins, industries, and influence, diving into their stories
                        within the broader economic context.</p><br>

                        <p>The number of billionaires has been <b>steadily increasing</b> over the years.
                            <br><br>Between 1996 and
                            2014, there was a nearly <b>4-fold increase</b> in the number - from 423 to 1653. Now let's
                            dive into the data for 2014 specifically. </p>

                        <p>The <b>top 100</b> billionaires held approximately <b>1/3</b> of the total wealth amongst
                            those 1653 billionaires in 2014, showcasing a concentration of wealth within a small group.

                        <p>The bar chart presents a breakdown of the world's billionaires by region and gender. Notably,
                            <FONT COLOR="#ffcade">Europe</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#e7ba52">North America</FONT> emerge as
                            regions with the highest numbers of billionaires.
                            <br><br>However, in every region, male billionaires considerably <b>outnumber</b> their
                            female counterparts. For instance, in <FONT COLOR="#ffcade">Europe</FONT>, the disparity is
                            significant with male billionaires vastly overshadowing the number of female billionaires.

            <h2>Exploring the Correlation Between GDP and Billionaires</h2>
            <div class="chart4">chart placeholder</div>
            <div>
                <p>It is shown that there is a correlation between the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the number of
                    billionaires in various countries for the year 2014. At a glance, the United States stands out
                    prominently, both in terms of its GDP and the count of billionaires. China, despite having a GDP
                    considerably less than that of the USA, exhibits a notable number of billionaires, suggesting a
                    substantial concentration of wealth within certain demographics.
                    <br><br>Similarly, the India, Russia and Australia have visible circles, indicating a significant
                    billionaire population, though they vary in GDP. South Africa, in contrast, has a smaller
                    billionaire circle despite its sizable GDP.
                    <br><br>This correlation can be due to the reason that the billionaires can significantly contribute
                    to the economy of their countries. On the other hand, countries with high GDP may attract those
                    billionaires to reside in for a better financial market.
