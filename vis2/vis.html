            <h1>A Glimpse into the World of Billionaires</h1>
            <p>In today's interconnected global landscape, the world economy is an intricate tapestry of trade,
                investment, and commerce.
                Within this vast expanse, a select group stands out: the billionaires. These individuals, through
                entrepreneurship, inheritance, or investments, have amassed fortunes that rival the GDPs of entire
                countries.
                Now it is time to explore into their origins, industries, and influence, diving into their stories
                within the broader economic context.</p><br><br>

                        <h3>Overall Trend</h3>
                        <p>The number of billionaires has been <b>steadily increasing</b> over the years. <br><br>Between 1996 and
                            2014, there was a nearly <b>4-fold increase</b> in the number - from 423 to 1653. Now let's dive into the data for 2014 specifically. </p>

                            <br><br>However, in every region, male billionaires considerably outnumber their female counterparts. For instance, in Europe, the disparity is significant with male billionaires vastly overshadowing the number of female billionaires.</p>

                        <p>There's a dense concentration of billionaires between the age range of 40 and 80. The majority of them possess wealth under 20 billion USD, with only a few outliers having substantially higher wealth.
